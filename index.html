    <h2>The Xbox One</h2>
    <p>The Xbox One is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. Announced on May 21, 2013, it is the successor to the Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox family. It directly competes with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. The Xbox One was released in North America, several European markets, Australia, and New Zealand on November 22, 2013, and in 26 other markets, including Japan, the remaining European markets, and the Middle East, in September 2014. It is also the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. Microsoft and various publications have classified the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system",making it a competitor to other digital media players, such as the Apple TV and Google TV platforms.</p>

    <p>Moving away from the Xbox 360's PowerPC-based architecture back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox the console features an Advanced Micro Devices processor built around the x86-64 instruction set. The Xbox One places an increased emphasis on cloud computing and entertainment integration, offering the ability to overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box with an enhanced program guide, split-screen multitasking of applications, and improved second-screen support. The console optionally includes an upgraded Kinect sensor, providing richer motion tracking and voice recognition for use in its graphical user interface (GUI) and games. The Xbox One also offers the ability for users to record and share highlights from or live-stream gameplay. The console's controller was refined over that of the Xbox 360, with a redesigned D-pad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback.</p>

    <p>Prior to its official release, the Xbox One received mixed reviews: the entertainment-oriented features were praised, but there was controversy surrounding several policy changes since the Xbox 360's release, including a proposed always-on digital rights management (DRM) system, and privacy concerns over a mandate that the Kinect be used at all times. Microsoft retracted these changes prior to the console's launch, and it received mostly positive reception for its refined controller design, multimedia features, user interface, and voice navigation.</p>

    <h2>The Playstation 4</h2>
    <p>The PlayStation 4 (officially abbreviated as PS4) is a home video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment.

The PlayStation 4's GPU can perform 1.843 teraflops. Sony calls the PlayStation 4 "the world's most powerful console", and speaking to Edge magazine, numerous game developers described the performance difference between the PS4 and Xbox One as "significant" and "obvious". During the 2014 fiscal year, PS4 topped video game global console sales.</p>

    <p>The console enables various methods of interactivity with other services and devices: the PlayStation App, designed to enhance gameplay by using iOS and Android mobile devices; PlayStation Now, a cloud-based subscription gaming service that offers streaming video game content; and wireless Remote Play, a feature that enables users to activate the PlayStation 4 from a distance, in order to continue playing on a secondary screen such as PlayStation Vita, or a Sony Xperia tablet or smartphone.</p>

    <p>Sony has placed emphasis on social gameplay. The new controller incorporates a "share" button, enabling the capture of screenshots and video.

    <h2>The Iconic Star Wars</h2>
    <p>Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. It depicts the adventures of various characters "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away", mostly involving, but not limited to, the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker.</p>

    <p>The first film in the series, Star Wars (later subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope), was released on May 25, 1977 by 20th Century Fox and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. It was followed by the similarly successful sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983); these three films constitute the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was later released between 1999 and 2005, which received a more mixed reaction from critics and fans, compared to the original trilogy. All six films were nominated for or won Academy Awards, and were commercial successes, with a combined box office revenue of $4.38 billion, making Star Wars the fifth highest grossing film series. The series has spawned an extensive media franchise the Star Wars expanded universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books, resulting in significant development of the series's fictional universe. Star Wars also holds a Guinness World Records title for the "Most successful film merchandising franchise." In 2012, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at USD $30.7 billion (£19.51 billion), including box-office receipts as well as profits from their video games and DVD sales.</p>

    <p>In 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion and announced three new Star Wars films, with the first film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, planned for release on December 18, 2015. 20th Century Fox retains the physical distribution rights to the first two Star Wars trilogies, owning permanent rights for the original 1977 film and holding the rights to Episodes I–III, V and VI until May 2020. The Walt Disney Studios owns digital distribution rights to all the Star Wars films, excluding A New Hope</.p>
